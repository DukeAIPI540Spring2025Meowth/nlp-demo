# This Streamlit script creates a mental health-oriented virtual assistant named "MindHeal Assistant".
# It provides empathetic, supportive responses using a locally fine-tuned Llama LLM, with an optional
# refinement and evaluation step performed by an external LLM ("Judge") powered by OpenAI. Users
# can select different visual themes ("moods") that dynamically change the app's color scheme, input
# API keys for OpenAI via a sidebar, and interact through text-based chat inputs.
# The assistant returns original and optionally refined responses and a numeric evaluation score.
# Important ethical disclaimers and guidance on the responsible use of this experimental tool
# are provided clearly throughout the user interface.
